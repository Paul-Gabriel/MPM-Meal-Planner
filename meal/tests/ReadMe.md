## Testing (tests/)

- This is where you write tests (Pytest).

- Unit Tests → entities, individual services.

- ex: scaling servings in Recipe

- ex: pantry decrement after cooking

- Integration Tests → how repositories + services collaborate

- ex: log cook → pantry updated → alert triggered

- Scenario Tests → end-to-end flow

- ex: import recipes → create plan → build shopping list → cook meal → leftovers
